# react_flask_mysql 

To accomplish this task:
1. Understand the User interface (REACT based)  in this github code.
3. create database and its tables for the relevant fields in mysql, based on the user interface.
4. create flask app which would connect mysql tables and the user interface (REACT) for the given system. The Database must be able to be entered, and modified if needed.
5. Must use SQLalchemy. Use flask blue print, if you can. Try to keep datbase models, routes separate from the main flask app file.
6. The database address will be shared once you are ready to solve the problem.
7. Show us a working web application with a flask server running on your computer.
8. Show us screenshots of the filled mysql tables after the user fresh registration and modification after a fresh registration.
