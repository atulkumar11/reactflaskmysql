# Project Task: `react_flask_mysql` Integration

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a fully functional web application by integrating a **React-based user interface** with a **MySQL database** using a **Flask backend**.

---

## 📋 Task Breakdown

### 1. Understand the Frontend (React)
- Review the provided GitHub repository containing the React interface.
- Identify the relevant fields and data flows that interact with the backend.

### 2. Design and Create the MySQL Database
- Create the required database schema based on the user interface.
- Define tables to store user data and support registration, login, and profile modification.

### 3. Develop Flask Backend with SQLAlchemy
- Create a Flask application that connects the React frontend with the MySQL database.
- Use **SQLAlchemy** for database ORM.
- Organize the backend using **Flask Blueprints** to separate:
  - Database models
  - API routes
  - Main application logic

### 4. Functional Requirements
- Enable full CRUD operations for user data.
- Ensure that:
  - Users can register and their data is stored in the database.
  - Users can modify their details, and changes are reflected in the database.

### 5. Demonstration Requirements
- Run the Flask server locally.
- Show a working integration with the React frontend.
- Provide **screenshots** of:
  - MySQL tables after a **new user registration**
  - MySQL tables after **modifying** an existing user

## 🛠️ Note
- The MySQL database address and access credentials will be provided once you're ready to proceed with implementation.
