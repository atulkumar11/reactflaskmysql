# react_flask_mysql 

To accomplish this task:
1. Understand the User interface in this git hub code.
3. create database and its tables for the relevant fields in mysql
4. create flask app which would connect mysql tables and the user interface for the login system. The Database must be able to be entered, and modified if needed.
5. Must use SQLalchemy. Use flask blue prints, if you can. Try to keep datbase models, routes separate from the main flask app file.
6. The database address will be shared once you are ready to solve the problem.
7. Show us a working web application with a flask server running on your computer.
